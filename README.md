# Intro to Spring Boot
**Description/Overview:** Spring Boot is an open source framework of libraries for the setup, programming, configuration, and deployment of Java microservice applications. Examples of Spring Boot features include diagnostic checks, production-ready metrics, customizable startup configurations, and embedded app servers (e.g., Jetty, Tomcat, Undertow). No code or XML generation is necessary to create Spring Boot projects, and best configurations for projects are automatically determined (and manually adjustable, as desired or needed).
  
**What is Spring Boot Actuator?:** This module includes production-environment tools for manging and monitoring Spring Boot app processes and performance. Insights into properties, metrics, diagnostics, and other characteristics are determined via the exposing of endpoints (e.g., '/actuator/metrics', '/actuator/info', /'actuator/health'). Spring Boot Actuator can be configured and integrated with third-party tools/technologies.
